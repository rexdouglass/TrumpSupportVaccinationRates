### JHU State Data

Ok so what I think we do is sum up everything we have for all the counties. Calculate the difference between the state total and that. Distribute the difference proportionally by population to the counties in that state. And then add the VA numbers right at the end. That should give us everything minus the DOD.

```{r}

if(fromscratch){
  jhu <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/govex/COVID-19/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/hourly/vaccine_people_vaccinated_US.csv")
  saveRDS(jhu, "/mnt/8tb_a/rwd_github_private/TrumpSupportVaccinationRates/data/vacovid19summary.Rds")

# Appendix 2: County Level Vaccine Uptake

### CDC

       filter(date==max(date)) %>% #Update to whichever date we pull the Democratandchronicle data #this fails because they may not have updated it to day when yo urun this
       mutate(fips=fips %>% as.numeric()) %>%
       mutate(series_complete_18plus_pop_pct=series_complete_18plus_pop_pct/100) %>%
       mutate(series_complete_pop_pct=series_complete_pop_pct/100) %>%
       mutate(series_complete_18plus_pop_pct=ifelse(series_complete_18plus_pop_pct %in% c(0,1), NA, series_complete_18plus_pop_pct )) %>%
       mutate(series_complete_pop_pct=ifelse(series_complete_pop_pct %in% c(0,1), NA, series_complete_pop_pct )) #%>%
    
       #filter(series_complete_18plus_pop_pct!=0 & series_complete_18plus_pop_pct!=1) %>%
       #dplyr::select(recip_state, recip_county, fips,series_complete_18plus_pop_pct, series_complete_pop_pct) %>%
       #mutate(retrieved=Sys.Date())
  dim(lhs_cdc)
  saveRDS(lhs_cdc, "/mnt/8tb_a/rwd_github_private/TrumpSupportVaccinationRates/data/cdc_vaccine_rates.Rds" )
}

lhs_cdc <- readRDS("/mnt/8tb_a/rwd_github_private/TrumpSupportVaccinationRates/data/cdc_vaccine_rates.Rds" ) %>%
  dplyr::select(recip_state, recip_county, fips, people_partial_cdc=administered_dose1_recip, people_complete_cdc=series_complete_yes  ) 

```

The distribution of up Uptake in the country is still abysmal, with the
median county at only 41%, and the 3rd quartile barely at 50%.

```{r, results=T, eval=F}
lhs_cdc %>% pull(people_partial_cdc) %>% summary()
```

90% of counties land between 12% and 63%. The measurement task therefore
isn't so much to explain high vaccine uptake from low, but rather to
identify stragglers with low uptake form the central mass.

```{r, eval=F}
lhs_cdc %>% pull(people_partial_cdc) %>% quantile(prob=seq(0,1,.01), na.rm=T)
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, eval=F}
lhs_cdc %>% ggplot(aes(x=people_partial_cdc)) + geom_histogram(bins=100)
```

So who are the stragglers? Here's a map showing the rates in the data.
Texas is missing entirely for reporting issues. A few very rural
counties are missing as well. The stragglers appear to be concentrated
in three states, George, Virginia, and West Virginia and more
sporadically across the midwest. Bounding effects that show state are
evidence of geogrpahic and administrative auto-correlation, from
administration, reporting, or both.

```{r, eval=F}

#devtools::install_github("UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr")
library(tidyverse)
library(urbnmapr)

map_data <- left_join(lhs_cdc, urbnmapr::counties %>% mutate(county_fips=county_fips %>% as.numeric() ), by = c("fips"="county_fips") )
p <- map_data %>%
  mutate(people_partial_cdc=ifelse(people_partial_cdc==0, NA, people_partial_cdc)) %>% #ignore 0 as missing
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, group = group, fill = people_partial_cdc)) +
  geom_polygon(color = NA) +
  coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
  labs(fill = "Partialy Vaccinated")

```

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8, results=T, eval=F}
p
```

Here is Uptake in tabular format that you can browse in its entirety.
Sorted by least Uptake, the top 100 offenders are all VA, WV, GA and one
county from MA. The values aren't just low but near 0, which should set
off alarm bells that there might still be measurement processes we
haven't accounted for. In fact, if we look at the [New York Times
Vaccine
tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html),
we find that they leave out precisely those three states as
"insufficient data." The [Washington Post's vaccine
tracker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/covid-vaccine-states-distribution-doses/)
excludes another three states, New Mexico, Colorado, and South Dakota
because less than 85% of vaccination records include a person's county
of residence.

### USA Today Network

The USA Today Network produces databases and visualizations for
affiliate, including the [COVID-19 Vaccine
Tracker](https://data.democratandchronicle.com/covid-19-vaccine-tracker/).
The details of the database are obscure but it pulls CDC data and fills
in missing or broken states with data directly from state health
agencies. We can pull their numbers for each county and compare them to
the CDC counts. Their data cover 3,222 counties.

"What are some limitations of the data?
1) The data collation process described above is a process in flux caused by the unpredictable changes in data access, data definitions and data formats provided by the CDC and states. 2) Many states report vaccinated doses administered which have no county residence information (due to missing information about residents or because the vaccinated individual does not live in that state). These vaccinations are not counted in our county-level vaccination counts. We find that these vaccinations do not make up more than 10% of any state’s total vaccination counts. 3) The county-level vaccination counts reported by the CDC do not include county residents vaccinated by Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Indian Health Service, and the Bureau of Prisons. Some states do include these vaccinations in their provided data, others do not. We are working to better disentangle and integrate these data."

### CovidActNow

Some states don't release county level information leading to under
reporting. Being next to a large county might also further distort
because the vaccinations are attributed to that bigger county.

### Compare and Synthesize

Compared to the Democrat and Chronicle data, the CDC systematically
under reports vaccinations in VA, GA, NC, etc. The CDC data have higher
numbers for PR as well as a few other counties. The Democrat and
Chronicle data also have all of Texas.

ARTICLE = """ New York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York.
... A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.
... Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared "I do" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other.
... In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her "first and only" marriage.
... Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of "offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree," referring to her false statements on the
... 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents.
... Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam.
... On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further.
... After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective
... Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.
... All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say.
... Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.
... Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted.
... The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney\'s Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security\'s
... Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called "red-flagged" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali.
... Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
... If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.
